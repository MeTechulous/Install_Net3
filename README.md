# Install_Net3
Tool to Manually Install .NET 3.5 Framework.

I created this tool due to GPOs in my environment that made it unnecesarilly 
difficult to simply install the .NET 3.5 framework.

If it doesn't work for you simply by running it as an admin, you may have to 
navigate to the location of the script and run it from the command line.
